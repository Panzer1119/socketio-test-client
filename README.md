```

And access the app form the command below:

```
This command runs the app on `http://localhost:8888`

However you can install the chrome or firefox extension.

For installing the Chrome extenstion:
1. Navigate to the extension manager of your chrome browser.
2. Turn on the development mode
3. Drag and drop the "extension" directory of the project onto the open panel.

You can also intall the Firefox addon from the following link:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/socketio-client/


You can also clone and run the app from the project root directory:

```bash
$ yarn
```
```bash
$ yarn start
```
or

```bash
$ yarn serve
```
